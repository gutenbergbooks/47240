<p><i>Witty.</i> Save you Gentlemen, how now? what are you
encount'red here? what fellows are these?</p>

<p><i>Old K.</i> Faith Sir, here's <i>Mars</i> and <i>Mercury</i>, a pair of
poor Planets it seems, that <i>Jupiter</i> has turn'd out to live by
their wits, and we are e'en about a little spark of charity to
kindle um a new fire.</p>

<p><i>Witty.</i> Stay, pray you stay Sir, you may abuse your charity,
nay, make that goodness in you no better than a vice; so many
deceivers walk in these shadows now a days; that certainly your
bounties were better spilt than reserv'd to so lewd and vicious
uses; which is he that professes the Soldier?</p>

<p><i>Ruin.</i> He that professes his own profession, Sir, and
the dangerous life he hath led in it, this pair of half score
years.</p>

<p><i>Witty.</i> In what services have you been, Sir?</p>

<p><i>Ruin.</i> The first that flesht me a Soldier, Sir, was that
great battel at <i>Alcazar</i> in <i>Barbary</i>, where the noble <i>English</i>
<i>Stukely</i> fell, and where that royal <i>Portugal Sebastian</i> ended his
untimely days.</p>

<p><i>Witty.</i> Are you sure <i>Sebastian</i> died there?</p>

<p><i>Ruin.</i> Faith Sir, there was some other rumour hop't
amongst us, that he, wounded, escap'd, and toucht on his
Native shore agen, where finding his Countrey at home more
distrest by the invasion of the <i>Spaniard</i>, than his loss abroad,
forsook it, still supporting a miserable and unfortunate life,
which (where he ended) is yet uncertain.</p>

<p><i>Witty.</i> By my faith Sir, he speaks the nearest fame of
truth in this.</p>

<p><i>Ruin.</i> Since Sir, I serv'd in <i>France</i>, the <i>Low Countreys</i>,
Lastly, at that memorable skirmish at <i>Newport</i>, where the
forward and bold <i>Scot</i> there spent his life so freely, that from
every single heart that there fell, came home from his resolution,
a double honor to his Countrey.</p>

<p><i>Witty.</i> This should be no counterfeit, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Old K.</i> I do not think he is, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Witty.</i> But Sir, me thinks you do not shew the marks of a
Soldier, could you so freely scape, that you brought home no
scarrs to be your chronicle?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Ruin.</i> Sir, I have wounds, and many, but in those parts
where nature and humanity bids me shame to publish.</p>

<p><i>Witty.</i> A good Soldier cannot want those badges.</p>

<p><i>Sir Greg.</i> Now am not I of your mind in that, for I hold
him the best soldier that scapes best, alwaies at a Cock-fencing
I give him the best that has the fewest knocks.</p></div>

it to her with hist, hiss, hiss, which is a fearful disgrace, he

<p><i>Sir Greg.</i> Why <i>Pompey</i>, thou art not stark mad, art thou?
Wilt thou not tell me how my Lady does?</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Your Lady?</p>

<p><i>Sir Greg.</i> Did she receive the thing that I sent her kindly,
or no:</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> The thing that you sent her, Knight, by the thing
that you sent, was for the things sake that was sent to carry
the thing that you sent, very kindly receiv'd; first, there is
your Indenture, now go seek you a servant: secondly, you
are a Knight: thirdly and lastly, I am mine own man: and
fourthly, fare you well.</p>

<p><i>Sir Greg.</i> Why <i>Pompey</i>? prethee let me speak with thee,
I'll lay my life some hare has crost him.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Knight, if you be a Knight, so keep you; as for
the Lady, who shall say that she is not a fair Lady, a sweet
Lady, an honest and a virtuous Lady, I will say he is a base
fellow, a blab of his tongue, and I will make him eat these
fingers ends.</p>

<p><i>Sir Greg.</i> Why, here's no body says so <i>Pompey</i>.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Whatsoever things have past between the Lady and
the other party, whom I will not name at this time, I say she
is virtuous and honest, and I will maintain it, as long as I can
maintain my self with bread and water.</p>

<p><i>Sir Greg.</i> Why I know no body thinks otherwise.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Any man that does but think it in my hearing,
I will make him think on't while he has a thought in his
bosom; shall we say that kindnesses from Ladies are common?
or that favours and protestations are things of no moment
betwixt parties and parties? I say still, whatsoever has been
betwixt the Lady and the party, which I will not name, that
she is honest, and shall be honest, whatsoever she does by day
or by night, by light or by darkness, with cut and long tail.</p>

<p><i>Sir Greg.</i> Why I say she is honest.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Is she honest? in what sense do you say she is
honest, Knight?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Greg.</i> If I could not find in my heart to throw
my dagger at thy head, hilts and all, I'm an ass, and no
Gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Throw your Dagger at me! do not Knight, I give
you fair warning, 'tis but cast away if you do, for you shall
have no other words of me, the Lady is an honest Lady, whatsoever
reports may go of sports and toys, and thoughts, and
words, and deeds, betwixt her and the party which I will not
name; this I give you to understand, That another man may
have as good an eye, as amorous a nose, as fair a stampt beard,
and be as proper a man as a Knight, (I name no parties) a
Servingman may be as good as a Sir, a <i>Pompey</i> as a <i>Gregory</i>,
a <i>Doodle</i> as a <i>Fop</i>; so Servingman <i>Pompey Doodle</i>, may be
respected as well with Ladies (though I name no parties) as
<i>Sir Gregory Fop</i>; so farewell:  <span class="directline">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

in his sleep, or else [he]'s a fool, or a knave, or both, one of
the three, I'm sure 'tis; yet now I think on't, she has not us'd
me so kindly as her Uncle promis'd me she should, but that's
all one, he says I shall have her, and I dare take his word for

<p><i>Hostess.</i> What thinks the Man now? Is not this strange at 13.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> Very good words, there's a tang in e'm, and a sweet
one, 'tis musick (wife) and now I come t'ee. Let us a little
examine the several conditions of our Paragraphistical suitors.
The first, a travelling Tailor, who by the mystery of his Needle
and Thimble, hath survey'd the fashions of the French, and
English; this Signior Ginger-bread, stitcht up in the shreds of a
g[a]udy outside, sows Linings with his cross-leg'd complement,
like an Ape doing tricks over a staffe, cringes, and crouches,
and kisses his forefinger.</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> Out upon him.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> A second, a lavolteteere, a saltatory, a dancer with
a Kit at his Bum, one that, by teaching great <i>Madonnas</i> to
foot it, has miraculously purchast a ribanded Wastcote, and
four clean pair of socks; a fellow that skips as he walkes, and
instead of sensible discourse, vents the curious conceit of some
new tune stolen from a Mask, or a bawdy dittie, elevated for
the <i>Pole Artick</i> of a Ladies chamber, in that file stands another
of your inamoratoes.</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> Hang him and his Fiddle together, he never fidles
any child of ours.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> The third, a Mongrel, got by a <i>Switzer</i> on an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
<i>Italian</i>; this puppy, being left well estated, comes to <i>Florence</i>,
that the world may take notice, how impossible it is for
experience to alter the course of nature; a fool (wife) and
indeed, a Clown turn'd Gallant, seldom or never proves other
than a gallant fool, this toy prates to little purpose other than
What's a Clock? Shall's go drink? De'e forsooth? and thank
ye heartily; I fear no art in him to catch thee, and yet we
must be tormented with this buzard amongst the rest.</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> 'Tis your own folly, forbid him the House.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> The fourth, a Mule-driver, a stubborn and a harsh
knave: the fifth a School-Master, a very amorous Pedant, run
almost mad with study of Sonnets, and Complements out of
old Play-ends, the last an Advocates Clerk, that speaks pure
Fustian in Law-terms: excellent Courtiers all, and all as neate
as a <i>Magnifio</i>'s post new painted, at his entrance to an office;
thou shalt have none of 'em. Laugh at 'em, do. I say thou
shalt have none of 'em.</p>

<p><i>Bian.</i> Still your command to me shall stand a Law.</p>

a fair, in clusters about the Man of Art, for Love-powders,
ingredients, potions, counsels, postures, complements, philters:

great festivall, when the court lies there, provide a great and
spacious Eng[li]sh Oxe, and rost him whole, with a pudding in's

you sod one in <i>Garguentuas</i> couldron, bring in more money,
then all the monsters of <i>Affrick</i>.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> Good Sir do your best for him; he's of my
acquaintance, and one if ye knew him&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> What is he?</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> He was once a man of infinite letters.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> A Scholar?</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> No sir, a packet carrier, which is alwaies a man
of many letters, you know: then he was Mule-driver, now he's
a gentleman, and feeds monsters.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> A most ungratefull calling.</p>

<p><i>Mule.</i> There's money for your direction; the price of the
Oxe Sir?</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> A hundred French crowns, for it must be a <i>Lincolne</i>-shire
Oxe, and a prime one:

<p><i>Hostes.</i> Pray forbear sir, we shall have a new quarrell.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> You durst not meet me 'ith field, I am therefore
come to spoyl your market.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> What's the newes with you sir.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Gentlemen, you that come hither to be most abominably
cheated, listen, and be as wise as your planet will suffer
you, keep your mony, be not gul'd, be not laught at.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Pedant.</i> What means this? would I had my mony again
in my pocket.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> The fellow is full of malice, do not mind him.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> This profest cheating rogue was my master, and
I confess my self a more preternotorious rogue than himself,
in so long keeping his villainous counsell.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Come, come, I will not hear you.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> No couz'ner, thou wouldest not hear me, I do
but dare thee to suffer me to speak, and then thou and all
thy divells spit fire, and spout <i>Aqua fortis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Speak on, I freely permit thee.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Why then know all you simple animals, you whose
purses are ready to cast the calf; if they have not cast it
already, if you give any credit to this jugling rascal, you are
worse than simple widgins, and will be drawn into the net
by this decoy duck, this tame cheater.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Ha, ha, ha, pray mark him.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> He does profess Physicke, and counjuring; for his
Physick; he has but two medicines for all manner of diseases;
when he was i'th' low countryes, he us'd nothing but butter'd
beer, colour'd with Allegant, for all kind of maladies, and that
he called his catholick med'cine; sure the Dutch smelt out it
was butter'd beer, else they would never have endur'd it for
the names sake: then does he minister a grated Dogs turd
instead of Rubarb, many times of Unicornes horn, which
working strongly with the conceit of the Patient, would make
them bescummer to the height of a mighty purgation.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> The rogue has studied this invective.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Now for his conjuring, the witches of <i>Lapland</i> are
the divells chare-women to him, for they will sell a man a
wind to some purpose; he sells wind, and tells you fortie
lyes over and over.</p>

<p><i>Hostess.</i> I thought what we should find of him.</p>

<p><i>Host.</i> Hold your prating, be not you an heretick.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Conjure! I'll tell you, all the divells names he calls
upon are but fustion names, gather'd out of welch heraldry;
in breif, he is a rogue of six reprieves, four pardons of course,
thrice pilloried, twice sung <i>Lacrym&aelig;</i> to the Virginalls of a carts
tail, h'as five times been in the <i>Gallies</i>, and will never truely
run himself out of breath, till he comes to the gallowes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> You have heard worthy gentlemen, what this lying,
detracting rascall has vomited.</p>

<p><i>Tay.</i> Yes certain, but we have a better trust in you, for
you have ta'en our money.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> I have so, truth is he was my servant, and for some
chastisement I gave him, he does practise thus upon me; speak
truely sirra, are you certain I cannot conjure?</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Conjure! ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Nay, nay, but be very sure of it.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Sure of it? why I'll make a bargain with thee,
before all these gentlemen, use all thy art, all thy roguery,
and make me do any thing before al this company I have
not a mind to, I'll first give thee leave to claime me for thy
bond slave, and when thou hast done hang me.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> 'Tis a match, sirra, I'll make you caper i'th' air
presently.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> I have too solid a body, and my belief is like a
Puritans on Good-Friday, too high fed with capon.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> I will first send thee to Green-land for a haunch
of venison, just of the thickness of thine own tallow.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Ha, ha, ha, I'll not stir an inch for thee.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Thence to <i>Amboyna</i> i'th' <i>East-Indies</i>, for pepper to
bake it.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> To <i>Amboyna</i>? so I might be pepper'd.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Then will I conveigh thee stark naked to <i>Develing</i>
to beg a pair of <i>brogs</i>, to hide thy mountainous buttocks.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> And no doublet to 'em?</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> No sir, I intend to send you of a sleeveless errand;
but before you vanish, in regard you say I cannot conjure,
and are so stupid, and opinionated a slave, that neither I,
nor my art can compell you to do any thing that's beyond
your own pleasure, the gentlemen shall have some sport, you
cannot endure a cat sirra?</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> What's that to thee Jugler?</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Nor you'll do nothing at my entreaty?</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> I'll be hang'd first.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Sit Gentlemen, and whatsoever you see, be not
frighted.</p>

</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Clow.</i> Now sir, will you not acknowledge that I have
mightily advanc'd your practice?</p>

<p><i>Forobos.</i> 'Tis confest, and I will make thee a great man for't.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> I take a course to do that my self, for I drink
sack in abundance.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> O my rare rascall! We must remove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Whither?</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Any whither: <i>Europe</i> is too little to be coz'ned by
us, I am ambitious to go to the <i>East-Indies</i>, thou and I to
ride on our brace of Elephants.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> And for my part I long to be in <i>England</i> agen; you
will never get so much as in <i>England</i>, we have shifted many
countryes, and many names: but trance the world over you
shall never purse up so much gold as when you were in
<i>England</i>, and call'd your self Doctor <i>Lambe</i>-stones.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> 'Twas an atractive name I confess, women were
then my only admirers.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> And all their visits was either to further their lust,
or revenge injuries.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> You should have forty in a morning beleaguer my
closet, and strive who should be cozen'd first, amongst four-score
love-sick waiting women that has come to me in a
morning to learn what fortune should betide them in their
first marriage, I have found above 94 to have lost their maiden-heads.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> By their own confession, but I was fain to be your
male midwife, and work it out of them by circumstance.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Thou wast, and yet for all this frequent resort of
women and thy hand[l]ing of their urinals and their cases, thou
art not given to lechery, what should be the reason of it? thou
hast wholsome flesh enough about thee; me thinks the divell
should tempt thee to't.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> What need he do that, when he makes me his
instrument to tempt others.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Thou canst not chuse but utter thy rare good parts;
thou wast an excellent baud I acknowledge.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Well, and what I have done that way, I will
spare to speak of all you and I have done sir, and though
we should&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> We will for <i>England</i>, that's for certain.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> We shall never want there.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Want? their Court of Wards shall want money
first: for I profess my self Lord Paramount over fools a[n]d
madfolkes.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Do but store your self with lyes enough against
you come thither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Why that's all the familiarity I ever had with the
Divell, my guift of lying, they say he's the Father of lyes;
and though I cannot conjure, yet I profess my self to be one
of his poor gossips. I will now reveale to thee a rare peece
of service.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> What is it my most worshipful Doctor <i>Lamb</i>-stones?</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Foro.</i> There is a Captain come lately from Sea,<br /></span>

up into a casket; great joy there was amongst them, &amp; forth
they are gone into the city, and my Host told me at his going
forth he thought he should not return till after supper: now
Sir, in their absence will we fall to our picklocks, enter the
chamber, seize the Jewels, make an escape from <i>Florence</i>, and
we are made for ever.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> But if they should go to a true conjurer, and fetch
us back in a whirle-wind?</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Do not believe there is any such fetch in <i>Astrology</i>,
and this may be a means to make us live honest hereafter.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> 'Tis but an ill road to't that lyes through the high
way of theeving.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> For indeed I am weary of this trade of fortune-telling;
and mean to give all over, when I come into
<i>England</i>, for it is a very ticklish quality.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> And i'th' end will hang by a twine thred.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Besides the Island has too many of the profession,
they hinder on[e] anothers market.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> No, no, the pillory hinders their market.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> You know there the jugling captain.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> I there's a sure card.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> Only the fore-man of their jury is dead, but he
dyed like a Roman.</p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> Else 'tis thought he had made work for the hangman.</p>

<p><i>Foro.</i> And the very <i>Ball</i>, of your false prophets, he's
quasht too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Clow.</i> He did measure the stars with a false yard, and
may now travail to <i>Rome</i>, with a morter on's head to see if
he can recover his money that way.</p>

<p><i>Bac.</i> O Sir, can any thing come sweeter to you, or strike
a deeper joy into your heart than your son's virtue?</p>

<p><i>Leon.</i> I allow his virtues: but 'tis not handsome thus to
feed my self with such moderate praises of mine own.</p>

<p><i>Bac.</i> The subject of our comendations is it self grown so
infinite in goodness, that all the glory we can lay upon it,
though we should open volumes of his praises, is a mere
modesty in his expression, and shews him lame still, like an ill
wrought peece wanting proportion.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> Yet still he is a man, and subject still to more
inordinate vices, than our love can give him blessing.</p>

<p><i>Bac.</i> Else he were a <i>god</i>: yet so near as he is, he comes
to heaven, that we may see so far as flesh can point us things
only worthy them, and only these in all his actions.</p>

<p><i>Leon.</i> This is too much my Queen.</p>

<p><i>Bach.</i> Had the <i>gods</i> lov'd me; that my unworthy womb
had bred this brave man.</p>

<p><i>Leon.</i> Still you run wrong.</p>

<p><i>Bach.</i> I would have liv'd upon the comfort of him; fed
on his growing hopes.</p>

<p><i>Leo.</i> This touches me.</p>

<p><i>Bach.</i> I know no friends, nor Being, but his virtues.</p>

<p><i>Le.</i> You have laid out words enough upon a subject.</p>

<p><i>Bach.</i> But words cannot express him Sir: why what a
shape Heaven has conceiv'd him in, oh Nature made him up!</p>

<p><i>Leon.</i> I wonder <i>Dutchess</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bach.</i> So you must: for less than admiration loses this
godlike man.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>


<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>In the following references to the text the lines are numbered from the top of the</i>
<i>page, including titles, acts, stage directions, &amp;c., but not, of course, the</i>
<i>headline or mere 'rules.' Where, as in the lists of Persons Represented,</i>
<i>there are double columns, the right-hand column is numbered after the left.</i></p></div>

<p>It has not been thought necessary to record the correction of every turned
letter nor the substitution of marks of interrogation for marks of exclamation
and <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. Full-stops have been silently inserted at the ends of speeches
and each fresh speaker has been given the dignity of a fresh line: in the
double-columned folio the speeches are frequently run on. Misprints in the
Quartos and the First Folio are recorded when they appear to be interesting.
A word or two from the printed text is attached to the variants recorded below
in cases where the variant, by itself, would not be sufficiently clear. Altered
punctuation is shown, usually, by printing the old punctuation.</p>

</p>

<p><i><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> is a custome used by some Writers in this Age to Dedicate their Playes to</i>
<i>worthy persons, as well as their other works; and there is reason for it,</i>
<i>because they are the best Minervaes of their braine, and expresse more puritie of</i>
<i>conceit in the ingenious circle of an Act or Sc&aelig;ne, then is to be found in the vast</i>
<i>circumference of larger Volumnes; and therefore worthy an answerable Mec&aelig;nas,</i>
<i>to honour and bee honoured by them. But not [h]aving any such Epistle from</i>
<i>the Authour (in regard I am not acquainted with him) I have made bolde my</i>
<i>selfe, without his consent to dedicate this Play to the Juditious in generall, of</i>
<i>what degree soever; not insinuating herein with any, be they never so great,</i>
<i>that want judgement, for to them it belongs not, though they pay for it, more</i>
<i>then in this respect, that like</i> &AElig;sops <i>Cocke, having met with a precious Stone by</i>
<i>accident, they knew not the true use thereof, but had rather have a Barlie-corne</i>
<i>to their humour, then a perfect Diamond. But leaving them to their ignorance</i>,
I <i>once againe dedicate this Booke to the Juditious, some whereof</i> I <i>have heard</i>
<i>commend it to be excellent, who, because they saw it Acted, and knew what they</i>
<i>spake, are the better to be beleeved: and for my part I censure it thus, That</i>
I <i>never red a better</i>.</p>
